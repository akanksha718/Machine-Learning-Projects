# A Combined Repository for Machine Learning Projects
1--My first Machine Learning project which predict whether it is mine or a rock using simple Logistic Regression
<br>
2--Diabetes Predicton System using support vector machine classifier
<br>
3--House Price Prediction System using XGBoost Regression Algorithm 
Key Idea Behind XGBoost Regression
XGBoost builds a series of decision trees one after another.
Each new tree tries to fix the errors (residuals) made by the previous trees.
This process is called boosting.
Very simple process:
Start with a weak model (first tree)
Calculate the error (difference between prediction & actual)
Build next tree to correct that error
Add the new tree to the final model
Repeat many times
After many trees, the final prediction becomes extremely accurate.
