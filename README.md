# A Combined Repository for Machine Learning Projects
1️⃣ Rock vs Mine Prediction

Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Dataset: Sonar Dataset

🔍 This model predicts whether the detected object in sonar signals is a Rock or a Mine.

✨ Features

Logistic Regression baseline model

Clean data preprocessing

High accuracy with minimal tuning

Easy-to-understand implementation

2️⃣ Diabetes Prediction System

Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

📌 Predicts whether a person is diabetic based on medical diagnostic data.

✨ Features

SVM for high-dimensional classification

Train/Test split

Accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix evaluated

Well-structured pipeline

3️⃣ House Price Prediction (XGBoost)

Algorithm: XGBoost Regression
Dataset: Bouston Housing Dataset

🏡 This model predicts house prices using advanced boosted trees.

🔑 Why XGBoost?

XGBoost builds multiple decision trees one after another, and each new tree fixes the mistakes of the previous ones.

Simple Working:
Start with weak model
Compute errors (residuals)
Add new tree to correct errors
Repeat boosting
Achieve highly accurate predictions

✨ Features

Handles missing data

Fast & optimized regression

Extremely good accuracy

Real-world dataset

4️⃣ Fake News Detection

Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Dataset: News Dataset (TF-IDF vectorized)

📰 Detects whether a news article is Real or Fake.

✨ Features

TF-IDF vectorization

Text cleaning (stopwords, stemming, lowercasing)

Accuracy & confusion matrix

Effective binary classification
